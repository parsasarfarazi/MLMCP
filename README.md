# Machine Learning Model Comparison App (Streamlit)

This Streamlit app allows you to compare the performance of different machine-learning models on a given dataset. It includes:

- *Logistic Regression*

- *Decision Tree*

- *Random Forest*

- *Neural Network (Multi-layer Perceptron)*

## Features

- *Model Selection:* Choose the model you want to evaluate from a sidebar menu.

- *Data Handling:* Run the models on both the original data and optionally on filtered data (you'll need to implement filtering logic). (In Progress...)

- *Dimensionality Reduction:* Choose between PCA or TSNE for dimensionality reduction to visualize high-dimensional data. (In Progress...)

- *Performance Metrics:* View each model's accuracy and computation time.

- *Visualization:*  Interactive scatter plots (2D) to visualize the model predictions on the reduced data.
