# Machine Learning Projects with NumPy and Scikit-learn

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using Python, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. 

## About

This repo is designed to be a learning resource for anyone interested in exploring the fundamentals of machine learning with Python. Each project demonstrates different concepts, algorithms, and techniques, providing practical examples and explanations.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in this repo:

• Logistic Regression: Implementing Scikit-learn's logistic regression model.

• Decision Trees: Implementing decision trees for classification using Scikit-learn's decision tree models.

• Neural Networks: Implementing simple neural networks using NumPy and Scikit-learn's neural network models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
      `git clone https://github.com/parsasarfarazi/Machine-Learning.git`
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
